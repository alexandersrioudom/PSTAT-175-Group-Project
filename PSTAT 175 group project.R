#So for the base model  I decided to see the effect of age and years on transplant just as a place to start. And then continued the project from there.

#Conclusion
#Original question:
#Testing survival against whether the subject
#had a transplant or not and then sub categorizing covariates
#into internal or external factors, with external being
#things like age and year and internal being surgery and
#mscore(mismatch score), and rejection(although not included
#in model)

#From our summary function on our coxph model, we can see
#that in comparison to not getting the transplant:

#Firstly, from the column marked z, gives a value
#of -1.652, which indicates
#that receiving a transplant is statistically significant.

#The regression coefficient for getting the transplant, being
#-0.80407, indicates that receiving a transplant has a 
#lower risk of death than not receiving one.

#The hazard ratio indicates that receiving 
#the transplant reduces the hazard by a factor of 
#0.446013, or 55.3987%, which is an indication 
#of being positive for receiving a transplant versus not.

#The confidence interval for this 
#hazard ratio is (.1712, 1.162)

#Then, in terms of whether internal or external factors
#are of more significance, we can see that:

#looking at the regression coefficients, the highest value
#is the mscore(0.25945), meaning that having a heart mismatch
#is a sign of a higher risk of death.
#The next highest value is age(.008034), which is as well
#associated with a higher risk of death, but not nearly
#as much as having a heart mismatch.
#Of the other covariates considered, their regression
#coefficients are negative, meaning that these values are 
#associated with having a lower risk of death,
#with year being at (-0.052584) and surgery being(-1.139818).
#This means that having prior bypass surgery is associated with
#the best prognosis for having a lower risk of death, in terms
#of the regression coefficients.
#In terms of our original question, external factors do not
#affect survivability as much as internal factors, as they have
#the highest and lowest values for the regression coefficients.

#Looking at the hazard ratios, the highest value is
#mscore(1.296217), which is followed by age(1.008067).
#Like before, this means that these covariates are 
#associated with an increased and higher risk of death, and
#mscore being more so.
#As opposed to year(0.948775) and surgery(0.31987), with both
#being associated with less and smaller risk of death,
#and like before, surgery being the lowest value meaning
#it is the most positively associated with a lower risk of 
#death.

#The hazard ratios for each of these covariates is as followed:
#mscore
#(.7608, 2.208)
#age
#(.9587, 1.060)
#year
#(.7000, 1.286)
#surgery
#(.1014, 1.010)

#in the order of highest to lowest association
#with risk of death

heart.gap1 <- coxph(Surv(heart$stop-heart$start,heart$event)~
                      heart$transplant+jasa.mscore1 + heart.age2
